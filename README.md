# Dask

- Testing how the Dask library can be used to execute a pipeline of Python functions in parallel with the added goal of being able to process large amounts of data on modest computational resources. 

- Use `dask.array` to read multiple data sources and perform computations with them as a single data array. Advanced uses of NumPy arrays when dealing with high dimensional data that also work on Dask arrays. 

- Building a pipeline of delayed computation with Dask DataFrame.

- Use the Dask Bag to read raw text files and perform simple text processing workflows over large datasets in parallel.
